### Darkside cookies

Set of little and usable helpers to make life a little bit sweetier.

### Darkside artists

Artists framework provides an Artist interface - a lightweight alternative to //android.graphics.drawable.Drawable// class. The main reasons are //PathArtist// and //MorphablePathArtist// implementations, used to seriously extend the possibilities of vector drawables and vector animations in Android.

### Darkside animations

Kotlin DSL to describe animations in an easy-to-write and easy-to-read declarative style. Can be used in a combination with //Darkside artists// framework.

### Darkside layouts

Reworked fork of famous ((https://github.com/Kotlin/anko/wiki/Anko-Layouts Anko Layouts)) DSL, that was unfortunately discontinued and declared as deprecated by Jetbrains. //Darkside layouts// is designed to be more lightweight and specific, than Anko was.
